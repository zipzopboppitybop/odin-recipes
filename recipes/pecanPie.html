    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pecans are native to North America. So, it is entirely fitting that a
      pecan pie would make an annual appearance at Thanksgiving along with our
      other native foodstuffs like turkey, pumpkin, and cranberries. Pecan pie
      itself, though, is a more recent invention. While the first printed
      recipes for the pie started appearing in the late 1800s, the pecan pie
      classic as we know it became popular through the marketing efforts of Karo
      in the 1930s to help sell their corn syrup, a necessary ingredient in the
      pie.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust</li>
      <li>
        2 cups pecans, coarsely chopped (save a few whole pecan halves to create
        a decoration on the surface of the pie, if you want)
      </li>
      <li>3 large eggs, slightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon molasses (unsulphured)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl vigorously mix together the
        eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, molasses, melted butter, vanilla, and
        salt, until smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Spread the chopped pecans over the bottom of a frozen pie shell. Pour
        the filling over the pecans.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes tent the pie loosely with
        aluminum foil to prevent the crust and pecans from getting too browned.
        Bake for another 35 to 45 minutes until the filling has set. The pie
        should be a bit wiggly in the center
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove from oven and let cool, note that the pie will be puffed up a bit
        when you first take it out of the oven. It will settle as it cools.
      </li>
    </ol>
