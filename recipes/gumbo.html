    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Gumbo is a popular stew in the state of Louisiana, and is the official
      state cuisine. It has a strong flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a
      thickener, and the Creole "holy trinity"- celery, bell peppers, and
      onions. It is most commonly prepared in a French dark roux. There is also
      different kinds of gumbo like Creole gumbo that usually contains
      shellfish, dark roux, and filé. Tomotaoes are sometimes found in Creole
      gumbo ,but there are many who believe that tomotaoes and okra don't go
      together. Cajun gumbo is mostly the same but also uses chicken. The dish
      is cooked for atleast three hours before eating.

      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste</li>
      <li>
        1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to
        taste
      </li>
      <li>4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
      <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
      <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy
        saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking
        constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20
        to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will
        burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of
        a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely
        chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring
        mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are
        tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside.(Do this
        before cooking roux if this is first time making roux)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot
        and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes
        dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun
        seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer
        soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder
        at the 45-minute mark.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium
        heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a
        slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until
        flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file
        gumbo powder just before serving.
