    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main,
      and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese
      (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If
      there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made
      from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or
      sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is
      usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may
      be flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin,
      or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors
      and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit,
      whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other
      ingredients. Also did you know that cheesecake isn't a cake? It's a tart!

      <li>20 Oreo cookies (regular)</li>
      <li>5 Tbsp butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>18 Oreo cookies, crumbled</li>
      <li>Whipped cream, for topping (optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream or plain full-fat yogurt</li>
      <li>24 oz. cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat oven to
        350°F (175°C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place a 9-inch springform in the center of a large sheet of heavy duty
        aluminum foil (about 18 by 18-inches). Carefully wrap foil around sides
        of cheesecake pan*, spray inside with non-stick spray.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a food processor or blender, pulse 20 Oreos to fine crumbs. In a
        medium mixing bowl stir together the Oreo crumbs and melted butter until
        well combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Press mixture into an even layer in bottom of prepared springform pan.
        Bake in preheated oven 9 - 10 minutes then allow to cool as you prepare
        the filling.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer or a stand mixer
        fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated
        sugar until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add in the sour cream or yogurt and the vanilla and mix well. Add eggs
        one at a time and mix on low speed just until combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Gently fold in 13 crumbled Oreo cookies. Do not over-mix. Pour the
        filling into the cooled crust.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the springform pan into a large roasting pan and place in the
        oven. Fill the roasting pan up with hot water until the water level
        comes about halfway up the outside of the cheesecake pan.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven 50 - 60 minutes, or until the center is almost
        set. Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Let the cheesecake
        rest in the oven for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature.
        Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Loosen the cheesecake from the rim of the pan and remove the rim. Top
        with whipped cream, crumble remaining 5 Oreos and sprinkle over
        cheesecake. Cut into slices and serve chilled.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Cover the cheesecake and store in refrigerator up to 4 days.</li>
