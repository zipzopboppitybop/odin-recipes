I am creating a recipe website with HTML
I used ul and ol for this ingredients and steps list respectively
I used different headings to show importance
i used links to link webpages together
I linked imgs to the files with the img element and changed their sizes with inline css
I used line breaks to make the lists looke a bit neater
